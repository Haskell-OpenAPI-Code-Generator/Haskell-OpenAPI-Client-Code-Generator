        Each login user only has one mobile trading assistant (MTA) alert with it's own unique tool id.
        The tool id cannot be changed. When modified a new order Id is generated. MTA alerts can not
        be created or deleted. If you call delete /iserver/account/:accountId/alert/:alertId,
        it will reset MTA to default. See [here](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/mobileiphonemobile/mobileiphone.htm#monitor/trading-assistant.htm) for more information on MTA alerts.

        \ **cOID** sent with the parent and set the same value for **parentId** in\
        \ each child order(s).\n  * Cash Quantity -  Send orders using monetary value\
        \ by specifying **cashQty** instead of quantity, e.g. cashQty: 200. The endpoint\
        \ /iserver/contract/rules returns list of valid orderTypes in cqtTypes.\n\

        \ **isCcyConv** = **true**. To specify the cash quantity use **fxQTY** instead\
        \ of quantity, e.g. fxQTY: 100.\n  * Fractional - Contracts that support fractional\
        \ shares can be traded by specifying **quantity** as a float, e.g. quantity:\
        \ 0.001. The endpoint /iserver/contract/rules returns a list of valid orderTypes\
        \ in fraqTypes.\n  * IB Algos - Attached user-defined settings to your trades\
